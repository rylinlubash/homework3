    <p id = 'main'>My name is Rylin Lubash. I'm a senior at Northeastern University studying /n
        Behavioral Neuroscience with a minor in Data Science. I’m originally from Washington /n
        state, right outside of Seattle. In May, I’ll be graduating and am hoping to continue /n
        my career in neuroscience research and eventually pursue a PhD in Neuroscience. I /n 
        currently volunteer in a lab on campus where we study the sex differences in fear /n 
        responses and the underlying circuitry in rats using Pavlovian fear conditioning and /n
        chemogenetics. The plan is to stay in the general field of learning and memory and fear /n
        in my next research position, which I am currently on the hunt for. </p>

    <p id = 'main'>Outside of my work and academics, I enjoy baking and reading. It can be hard /n
        to find time for hobbies during the busy semester, but I do my best. Lately, I’ve been /n 
        reading Babel by R.F. Kuang, which is a fascinating fantasy novel full of meticulous /n
        worldbuilding to make you believe in their magic. I also read The Mountain Under the Sea /n
        by Ray Nayler a few months ago, and it was definitely my top book of 2024. It’s about a future /n
        where artificial intelligence and robots run rampant in a Earth stricken by climate change, and /n
        a newly discovered species of octopus that has developed a language. </p>
