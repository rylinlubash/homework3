    <h1> About Me </h1>

    <p id = 'main'>My name is Rylin Lubash. I'm a senior at Northeastern University studying 
        Behavioral Neuroscience with a minor in Data Science. I’m originally from Washington 
        state, right outside of Seattle. In May, I’ll be graduating and am hoping to continue 
        my career in neuroscience research and eventually pursue a PhD in Neuroscience. I 
        currently volunteer in a lab on campus where we study the sex differences in fear 
        responses and the underlying circuitry in rats using Pavlovian fear conditioning and 
        chemogenetics. The plan is to stay in the general field of learning and memory and fear 
        in my next research position, which I am currently on the hunt for. </p>

    <p id = 'main'>Outside of my work and academics, I enjoy baking and reading. It can be hard 
        to find time for hobbies during the busy semester, but I do my best. Lately, I’ve been 
        reading Babel by R.F. Kuang, which is a fascinating fantasy novel full of meticulous 
        worldbuilding to make you believe in their magic. I also read The Mountain Under the Sea 
        by Ray Nayler a few months ago, and it was definitely my top book of 2024. It’s about a future 
        where artificial intelligence and robots run rampant in a Earth stricken by climate change, and 
        a newly discovered species of octopus that has developed a language. </p>
