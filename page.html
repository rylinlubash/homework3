    <p id = 'main'>I’ve been baking since I was a child, and my favorite things to bake 
      are the most technical complex recipes. I also have a major sweet tooth, so I make 
      almost exclusively desserts. When I was younger, I got really into watching YouTubers 
      like Claire Saffitz and Sally’s Baking Addiction and learning about how the recipes work 
      and why. I found this fascinating, and the skills I learned help me to make more complex 
      baked goods. I am always pushing my skills to make some new recipe for a pastry I haven’t 
      tried before. This was partially driven by my mom being a terrible baker. While most people 
      who like to bake learned how to from their mom, I figured out how to bake to stop her from 
      ignoring recipes and timers and burning cakes. </p>
    <br>
    <p id = 'main'>When I’m baking something quickly for comfort, I usually make chocolate chip 
      bar cookies, brownies, or banana bread. However, I find it the most fun and rewarding to 
      find fancy complex recipes and try to make them. This way I get to learn about how my 
      favorite desserts are made. Below is a list of some recent desserts I’ve baked, some much 
      more complex than others. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Things I've baked recently: </p>
